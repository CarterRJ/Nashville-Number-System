						<strong>All you need to know is the major triad</strong>. The
						major triad is made up to the numbers 1 3 and 5. For example in
						the key of C the major triad is C E G. For this postion every
						degree of the scale is never more than a tone (or whole step) from
						this postion. 2 is a tone away from 1 and 3. 4 is a semitone up
						from 3 and tone down from 5. 6 is and tone up from five. of time.
					</p></li>
				<li><p>
						<strong>All you need to know are the 1, 4 and 5 chords</strong>.
						I'm sure you heard this before "150 songs you can play with just
						three chords" or "All songs can played with just 3 simple chords".
						Clearly a gross over-simplification BUT it is not far from the
						truth <strong>This is the most important lesson on this site if
							you only learn one thing, learn this:</strong>

					</div> Notice the symmetry and how the only chords you need to know
					are the 1, 4 and 5. <br /> If the progression is 1 5 6 4:
					<ul>
						<li>You play a 1 in the bass with a 1 chords</li>
						<li>A 5 is the bass with a 5 chord</li>
						<li>A 6 in the bass with a 1 chord</li>
						<li>A 4 in the bass with a 4 chord</li>
					</ul>
					</p></li>
				<li><p>
						<strong>Why does this work?</strong> If you're obsessed about
						music theory or just one of those people who like understand
						rather than take things at face value here we go... <br /> If you
						know your <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/43">diatonic
							chords theory</a> then you would know that number 1, 4 and 5 are
						major; 2, 3 and 6 are minor and the 7 is diminished. <br /> As you
						can see from the table above playing a 4 chord over a 2 bass
						creates a minor 7 chords. E.g. D + F A C = D F A C (Dm7).
					</p> Notice how whilst thinking in terms of simple major chords you
					can create more complex chord qualities like a minor 7.
					<p></p>
					<p>The astute among you may have recognised the anomalous "soft
						minor" chord quality. This is not a technical term but it's what I
						call it, and it fits. The reason why we use soft minors is because
						diminished chords sound wierd and a real minor on the 3 is usually
						too harsh. Also it would mess with my symmetry..</p></li>
				<li><p>
						<strong>TIP: All keys overlap!</strong> You've probably heard of <a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths">the circle
							of fifths</a> and how important it is, and whoever told you was
						right.<br /> Take this subset of the circle of fifths: F C G.
					
					<ul>
						<li>The key of F is: F G A Bb C D E F</li>
						<li>The key of C is: C D E F G A B C</li>
						<li>The key of G is: G A B C D E F# G</li> 
					</ul>
						<u>Notice anything??</u>
					<ul>
						<li>The first half of the C major (CDEF) is the last half of the F
							major scale.
						<li>The second half of the C major scale (GABC) is the first half
							of the the G major scale.</li> The chords are the same!
						<strong>When you learn the chords in one key you also learn half
							the chords in two other keys!</strong>
					</ul>
